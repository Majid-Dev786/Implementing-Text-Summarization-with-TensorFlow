# Implementing Text Summarization with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to implement a text summarization model using TensorFlow and Keras. 

The model employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture, utilizing LSTM networks for both the encoder and decoder components. 

This example trains on a small dataset of documents and their respective summaries to showcase the basics of text summarization.

## Description

Text summarization is a process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text document. 

This implementation focuses on a basic form of extractive summarization using deep learning techniques. 

By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, it showcases how to prepare text data, build a seq2seq model, and train it for summarization tasks.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:
